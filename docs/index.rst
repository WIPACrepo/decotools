Decotools is a python package for analyzing data collected by the `Distributed Electronic Cosmic-ray Observatory (DECO) <https://wipac.wisc.edu/deco/home>`_.

DECO is a citizen science project that enables users around the world to detect cosmic rays and other energetic particles with their cell phones and tablets. The recorded events are automatically uploaded to a central database. In addition to detecting particle events, users can analyze the data produced by their own or other usersâ€™ phones.
